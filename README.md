# Let's do DSA together

#### Here in this repository we will create complete codebase for many important topics usually asked in coding interviews starting from basic topics like arrays, strings, math to some advanced algo's like dp, greedy, backtracking and some very important data structures like trees, linked list, graphs, stacks etc. You just have to add your codes in respective folders if they present and if they don't just add them.

## This repository for all peeps who are eager to contribute to hacktoberfest thing

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd directory-name
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-hritik
```

## Add new file 

If the folder for that topic exist , add a new cpp file with file name as problem number. if the folder for that topic does not exist , create a new one and add the cpp file . 
For example : 
```
for the problem reverse the array 3 : array->0.cpp   
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review
