# Let's do DSA together

#### Here in this repository we will create complete codebase for many important topics usually asked in coding interviews starting from basic topics like arrays, strings, math to some advanced algo's like dp, greedy, backtracking and some very important data structures like trees, linked list, graphs, stacks etc. You just have to add your codes in respective folders if they present and if they don't just add them.

## This repository for all peeps who are eager to contribute to hacktoberfest thing

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-hritik
